Learning materials will be developed by the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion. It is an entry level course that will provide an introduction to the issues. For those looking to extend their learning on these topics, we will provide links for materials that explore the issues in greater depth. We will utilise existing resources but will target lessons specifically to a multi-ethnic Myanmar audience and invite reflection on the relevance of the issues to the Myanmar context. The lessons will encourage critical thinking and reflection. They will cover an introduction to statelessness; citizenship and discrimination; childhood statelessness; citizenship stripping; statelessness and forced migration; and access to citizenship in Myanmar. Most learning materials will be in English. Where possible we will provide written and listening materials in Burmese. Following the release of each lesson and a self-study period, we will also be available for discussion sessions with the students. We also encourage peer-to-peer discussion of the lessons.")) )

The first episode will cover how history curricula have been used as political tools in Burma and worldwide. The other 5 episodes use primary source documents to deconstruct these 5 myths by examining how they came about and who they benefit: 1. All the ethnic groups were happily united under the rule of the Burmans before the British colonized the region. 2. There are 8 national races and 135 ethnic groups indigenous to Myanmar. 3. All the national races agreed to unify in the Panglong Agreement. 4. Myanmar is a Buddhist country. 5. The 1962 military coup was necessary to prevent the country from disintegrating.")

The aim is to provide students with conceptual tools to analyse labour and employment dynamics and trends in their own country and elsewhere. The course will familiarise students with key moments in Myanmar labour history, and with the importance of workers and labour in the country’s development. By highlighting ongoing theoretical debates about labour and employment, the course will prompt students to draw on their own experience and knowledge to make sense of the diversity of historical and contemporary labour arrangements in Myanmar, and labour arrangements affecting Myanmar migrant workers abroad.")
